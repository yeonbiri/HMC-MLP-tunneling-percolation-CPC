# Hybrid Monte Carlo–MLP Prediction of Tunneling Conductivity in CPCs

## Overview
This repository provides the MATLAB source codes used in the manuscript: “Hybrid Monte Carlo–MLP prediction of tunneling percolation and conductivity in conductive polymer composites under compressive strain”, submitted to Computational Materials Science.

The codes implement a hybrid computational framework combining 3D Monte Carlo (MC) particle-network simulations with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) surrogate model. This framework is designed to predict tunneling-governed electrical conductivity and percolation behavior in conductive polymer composites (CPCs) under compressive deformation, considering variables such as filler aspect ratio, volume fraction, and Poisson's ratio.
